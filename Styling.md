Currently react-imba-tables uses `Bootstrap 4` markup and classes for styling. Future versions will
provide customization possibilities as well as other Libraries like `Foundation` etc.

So, if you wan't your table to look nice, dont't forget to include `Bootstrap 4` css for example
via `CDN`.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.4.1/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-Vkoo8x4CGsO3+Hhxv8T/Q5PaXtkKtu6ug5TOeNV6gBiFeWPGFN9MuhOf23Q9Ifjh" crossorigin="anonymous">
